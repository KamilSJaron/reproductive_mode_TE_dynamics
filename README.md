# The influence of reproductive mode on TE dynamics

How does the mode of reproduction affects transposons dynamics? Previous theoretical work suggested either a accumulation or decrease in the absence of sexual repdrocution. In non-recombining portions of genomes in sexual organisms, typically an accumulation is found. But empirical estimates in natural populations of completely asexuals compared to sexuals could not detect any TE load difference. This is due to many confoudning effects liek hybridization or polyploidy or differences in population sizes. How to find out?

Experimental evolution is way to go. [McDonald et al.](www.nature.com/doifinder/10.1038/nature17143) have produced replicate lines of yeast with a common ancestral genetic background both allowing and disabling sexual reproduction. These lines were evolving for almost thousand generations and sequenced every 90 generations. We used this dataset to estimate TE dynamics in the yeast finding that TE numbers decline in asexual yeast almost by 20%, sexuals on the other hand maintain a stable 'equilibrium' TE load. We further simulated the experiment to generate insights into the mechanism behind and developed a theory that could explain the observed data.
