# Yeast TE load prediction

[McDonald et al.](www.nature.com/doifinder/10.1038/nature17143) have produced one of the most exciting experimental datasets for questions about evolution of sex. Sexual and asexual yeast lineages were kept under selection pressure, constant population size, and sequenced every 90 generation in total ~1000 generation experiment. They have evaluated the effect of sex on directional evolution, clearly demonstrating its advantages.

However, there is way more to be done in such system. [Jens' previous work](https://doi.org/10.1093/molbev/msv261) have suggested that asexuality is not causing higher TE loads, which is not conflicting much with theory, that predicts actual decrease in TE load in the absence of sex for sufficiently large populations by [Dolgin and Charlesworth](https://dx.doi.org/10.1534%2Fgenetics.106.060434).

Jens and his colleagues have estimated TE loads of McDonald yeast dataset. They found that levels of TE loads were approximately same in sexual yeast over the experiment, but simnifically decreasing in the asexual populations. Huge advantage is that the yeast experiment was in very much controlled environment therefore it should be straightforward to estimate is decline of TE loads in numerically in agreement with the Doligin and Charlesworth's stochastic model.

## Yeast parameters

Yeasts have only LTR transposable elements. Known parameters collected by Jens I can operate with. :

- LTR-LTR recombination frequency (something that deactivate a TE): ~1*10^-6 independent of temperature
- Transposition in 30Â°C: ~1*10^-6 This might be very crude, it can be in range : 0.7*10^-6 - 10.6*10^-6
- Fitness effect: <2% reduction per single element insertion
- Effective Population size: 100,000
- Generations: 1000

In the empirical data, the asexuals reduce TEs by ca 17.5 (for all) - 23.5% (ca 9 copies lost for full-length TEs (active)) depending on what we look at.

## Notes :

Jens have sent me more models that might be considered.
