# TE dynamics with respect to reproduction mode

How reproduction mode affects dynamics of transposons? Previous theory says that they can survive, previous observations in various asexuals show no more TEs than in sexuals. Is there a way how to get new insights?

Yes, experimental evolution is way to go. [McDonald et al.](www.nature.com/doifinder/10.1038/nature17143) have produced two lines of yeast with common genetic background both allowing and disabling sexual reproduction. These lines were evolving for almost a thousand generations and sequenced every 90 generations. We used this dataset to estimate TE dynamics in the yeast finding that asexual yeast decline number of TEs almost by 20%, sexuals on the other hand maintain the stable TE load. We further developed a theory that could explain the observed data.
